# Module 7 – Pointers and Memory (C++)

## Description
This program demonstrates the use of pointers and dynamic memory in C++.  
It dynamically allocates an array of `Item` structures, searches the data using binary search, and properly frees memory using `delete[]`.

## Requirements Met
- Defines a struct Item with name (string) and id (int)
- Uses new to dynamically allocate an array of 100 items
- Populates the array with sorted sample data
- Implements binary search to find an item by ID
- Prompts the user for an ID and displays the result
- Frees memory using delete[]
