# week 3

This program covers debugging and logic in C++.

The code has two parts.  
The first part creates a simple menu using if statements where the user can choose an option.  
The second part asks the user to enter three numbers and uses nested if statements to find and print the largest number.

This assignment demonstrates fixing syntax and logical errors and using if and nested if statements correctly.
