Assignement 2 
The program shows how constructors and destructors work in classes. I was able to create a class called Product with private attributes this time: id, name, and price. 
The class includes a cosntructor that initializes these values and prints "Constructor called" when a Product object is created. I also added a desctructor that prints
"Destructor called" when the object goes out of scope or the program ends. The class also has a PrintDetails() method that prints the products ID, name and price. 
In the main() function, I created a Product object with sample data called printDetails() to verify its behaviour. And when the program ends, the destructors runs automatically.
